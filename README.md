# barcodeutils
In processing data from many new sequencing-based techs, you often have to parse out the sequences you care about, like indices, UMIs, barcodes in r1 or r2, etc. This also involves correcting some subset of these sequences to a known set of programmed sequences to allow for error correction.

`barcodeutils` automates each of these tasks with a simple interface. For example, let's say you have an assay where you read i7, i5 reads as barcodes, the first 8bp of r1 as a unique molecular identifier (UMI), and the next 10 bp of r1 as another barcode.
```
import barcodeutils as bu

# Any known barcodes for error correction
my_r1_barcodes = ["TTCTCGCATG", "TCCTACCAGT", "GCGTTGGAGC", "GATCTTACGC", "CTGATGGTCA", "CCGAGAATCC", "GCCGCAACGA", "TGAGTCTGGC"]
my_i7_barcodes = ["TCGGATTCGG", "TCCGGCTTAT", "TCGCCGCCGG", "TTGGCAAGCC", "CAGCTAGCGG", "GTAGGATAAG", "AAGTAGCTCA", "TAAGTCCTGA", "GCGGCTGCGG", "ACCAGGCGCA", "CCGTATGATT", "TTGATTGGCG"]
my_i5_barcodes = ["CTCCATCGAG", "TTGGTAGTCG", "GGCCGTCAAC", "CCTAGACGAG", "TCGTTAGAGC", "CGTTCTATCA", "CGGAATCTAA", "ATGACTGATC"]

# Define specification
barcodes = {
    'i5': {
        'start': 1,
        'end': 10,
        'read': 'i5',
        'whitelist': my_i5_barcodes
    },
    'i7': {
        'start': 1,
        'end': 10,
        'read': 'i7',
        'whitelist': my_i7_barcodes
    },
    'umi': {
        'start': 1,
        'end': 8,
        'read': 'r1'
    },
    'r1_barcode': {
        'start': 9,
        'end': 18,
        'read': 'r1',
        'whitelist': my_r1_barcodes
    }
}

# Extract those corrected sequences from fastqs
fastq1 = 'myfastq.R1.fastq.gz'
fastq2 = 'myfastq.R2.fastq.gz'

for entry in bu.parse_fastq_barcodes(fastq1, fastq2, spec=barcodes, edit_distance=2):
    # you can now access any barcodes from spec
    umi_seq = entry['umi']
    r1_barcode_seq = entry['r1_barcode']

    # You can also access r1/r2 seq, name, quals automatically
    r1_seq = entry['r1_seq']
    r1_quals = entry['r1_quals']
    r1_name = entry['r1_name']
```

Any barcode defined with a whitelist will be corrected to the closest element within the whitelist within the specified edit distance. If there is no match or it would match to more than one barcode, then `None` is returned for that barcode seq.

# Dealing with Different Sequencers
A common problem is dealing with the fact that MiSeq/NextSeq sequencers, for example, will produce i5 sequences that are a reverse complement of one another.

`parse_fastq_barcodes` has an additional argument `rc_i5` which will reverse complement the i5 read before extracting your specified i5 barcodes.

In case it is useful, `barcodeutils` also provides helper functions to help determine whether this needs to happen automatically based on the FASTQ or BCL directory.

TODO function to infer from RunInfo.xml and one to infer from instrument model in fastq names.

# General Utilities
## Barcode Correction
If you just want to correct sequences to a known list of sequences, we also offer a standalone barcode correction tool.
```
my_r1_barcodes = ["TTCTCGCATG", "TCCTACCAGT", "GCGTTGGAGC", "GATCTTACGC", "CTGATGGTCA", "CCGAGAATCC", "GCCGCAACGA", "TGAGTCTGGC"]

r1_correcter = bu.BarcodeCorrecter(my_r1_barcodes, edit_distance=2)

corrected = r1_correcter.correct("CACCTTACGC") # GATCTTACGC

# Can also get other basic stats like the closest hamming distances or length
## TODO maybe make this spit back the pairs they correspond to
print(r1_correcter.get_min_hamming(n=3))

print(r1_correcter.get_barcode_length())
```

## Getting Run Info
If you have the BCL directory to the run and just want some basic info about it like read lengths, flow cell ID, date, instrument ID, lanes, you can get those returned as a dict like this:
```
bcl_directory = '/path/to/bcl/'
run_info = bu.get_run_info(bcl_directory)
```

## Reverse Complement DNA
```
seq = 'ATAGAGAC'
rc = bu.reverse_complement(seq)
```

# Installation
TODO put on pip, but for now can install via `setup.py`
